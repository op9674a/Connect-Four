# Connect-Four
Welcome to Charlie Brown Tic-Tac-Four!

Approach: Players are tied to their matching icons, and icon placement is based on the number of clicks. 

I attempted to determine icon placement based on the number of clicks on the selected column and managed to get the left-most column working, but the others did not take to it. So, this became "Tic-Tac-Four". 

Players should be able to take turns placing their icons - either Charlie Brown or Snoopy on their desired spot. 
If a player succeeds in placing their icon in four adjacent spots vertically or horizontally, an alert will pop up announcing that they win the game!
